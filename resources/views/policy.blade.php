</ul>
<div><strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></div>
<div>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</div>
<div>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div>
<div><strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></div>
<div>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</div>
<div><strong>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>

<div>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-custom-class="link">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</div>
<div>If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-custom-class="link">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.</div>

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact" data-custom-class="link">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.</div>

<div><strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></div>
<div>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</div>
<div><strong>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>

<div><u>Verification process</u></div>
<div>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</div>
<div>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</div>
